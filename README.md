üìö [Documentation](https://docs.vortex.dev/) | üìä [Performance Benchmarks](https://bench.vortex.dev)

## Overview

Vortex is a next-generation columnar file format and toolkit designed for high-performance data analytics. It provides:

- **‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing Fast Performance**
    - 100-200x faster random access reads than Apache Parquet
    - 2-10x faster scans with similar compression ratios and write throughput
    - Efficient support for wide tables with zero-copy/zero-parse metadata

- **üîß Extensible Architecture**
    - Modeled after Apache DataFusion's extensible approach
    - Pluggable encoding system
    - Zero-copy compatibility with Apache Arrow
